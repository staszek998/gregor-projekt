# GREGOR PROJEKT

This project has been developed as an example on how the website [gregorprojekt.com](http://gregorprojekt.com/) could be improved, as well as to improve my front-end programming skills within HTML, CSS, JS and the _React_ framework. There was no design for this project - the website's GUI is an effect of my heroic efforts to make it look at least not unsightly ;)

There was only taken a slight inspiration from the current website look.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for the development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software:

- Node JS
- npm

### Running the project

This project is based on the _create-react-app_ boilerplate by _Facebook_ and has the built-in dev server. To get it running, type the following commands:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

If you are more interested in getting the compiled production build, please type:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

---

Alternatively, you can use the `npm run` command instead of `yarn`.

### Running the live version

You can also view the [live website](https://gregor-projekt.netlify.com/) hosted on the _Netlify_ servers.
